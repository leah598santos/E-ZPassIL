# E-ZPassIL


## Description


E-ZPassIL is a lightweight React starter application designed to help users manage and track toll-related expenses, receipts, and pass usage in a clean and approachable interface. The project demonstrates best practices for component structure, styling, and state management while providing a small, easy-to-extend codebase for learning or prototyping transportation-payment utilities. It includes a simple expenses list, receipt viewer, and a form-driven UI for adding and editing entries.
